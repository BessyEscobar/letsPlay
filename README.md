# Snake Game üïπÔ∏èüêçüíª

## Description

This is a classic Snake game built with **React.js**. The game follows the traditional rules: you control the snake to eat the food that appears on the screen. Each time the snake eats the food, it grows, and the game gets harder as the snake becomes longer. The objective is to avoid colliding with the walls or the snake itself.

## Features

- **Classic Snake Gameplay**: The snake moves around the screen, eats food, and grows.
- **Game Over Screen**: When the snake collides with itself or the wall, a game over screen will appear.
- **Score Counter**: Keeps track of your score, which increases with each food eaten.
- **Responsive Design**: The game works on both desktop and mobile devices.
- **Start Button**: A button to start the game without refreshing the page.

## Technologies Used

- **React.js**: The game is built using React for managing the UI and game logic.
- **CSS**: For styling the game components and making the interface responsive.
- **JavaScript**: Used to handle the game mechanics, such as controlling the snake's movement, detecting collisions, and updating the score.
